Navigation from the /apps page failed because the backend didn't have any App templates. The frontend tries to create a Project referencing an App ID fetched from `/api/registry/apps/`, but that list was empty so the POST `/api/registry/projects/` returned `400 Bad Request`. The project never got created and navigation to `/workflow` stopped.

The fix seeds four default App records during `create_tenant.py` execution. Now the `/apps` endpoint returns IDs and project creation succeeds, so selecting an app navigates correctly into Workflow mode.
\nNew issue: 500 error creating projects due to missing "state" column in historical projects. Added migration 0004_historicalproject_state to fix.
\nClient creation returned 403 because CSRF validation was enforced on the tenants API. Added CsrfExemptSessionAuthentication in TenantViewSet and DomainViewSet so frontend POSTs succeed.
\nClient creation failed with 500 because tenant migrations weren't executed. The serializer now runs migrate_schemas and seeds default apps inside the new schema before creating subscription data.
