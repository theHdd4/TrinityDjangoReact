Navigation from the /apps page failed because the backend didn't have any App templates. The frontend tries to create a Project referencing an App ID fetched from `/api/registry/apps/`, but that list was empty so the POST `/api/registry/projects/` returned `400 Bad Request`. The project never got created and navigation to `/workflow` stopped.

The fix seeds four default App records during `create_tenant.py` execution. Now the `/apps` endpoint returns IDs and project creation succeeds, so selecting an app navigates correctly into Workflow mode.
\nNew issue: 500 error creating projects due to missing "state" column in historical projects. Added migration 0004_historicalproject_state to fix.
\nClient creation returned 403 because CSRF validation was enforced on the tenants API. Added CsrfExemptSessionAuthentication in TenantViewSet and DomainViewSet so frontend POSTs succeed.
\nClient creation failed with `relation "registry_app" does not exist`. The
`migrate_schemas` call inside the serializer did not always apply tenant
migrations. The serializer now invokes `tenant.create_schema(check_if_exists=True)`
so migrations run reliably before seeding default apps.
